remote repository


git remote add origin "http://url.com/abc.git" 		-> remote repository URL is stored in alias name origin (alias name can be anything)
git remote set-url origin "url.changed"			-> changing url of alias origin
git remote						-> show all remote repository alias name
git remote -v						-> show all remote repository alias name with URL
git push <remoteRepoAliasName> <branchname>		-> push <branchname> to <remoteRepoAliasName>
git push origin master				

git push -u origin master				-> -u is used to set <remoteRepoAliasName> <branchname>, so from next time we can use "git push"
git push						-> since -u used above no need to write orgin master


git clone "http://url.com" 				-> clone repository in current directory
git clone "http://url.com" <foldername>			-> clone repository into <foldername>
